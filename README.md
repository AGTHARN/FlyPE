FlyPE is a fly plugin for pocketmine that allows you to fly in survival mode when you run the fly command! There are many different features in the plugin that makes it special, and you should check them out!

This plugin would be useful for big or skyblock servers that would not like players to use fly in PVP zones or the hub. And if you would like players to pay for toggling flight, there's an option for that!

This plugin is in English and there are even customizable messages for those that want to use other languages.
